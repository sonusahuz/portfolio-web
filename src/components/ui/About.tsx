                  Hello! My name is Sonu Sahu, a{' '}
                  <span className="font-semibold">software developer</span> with
                  a great passion for creating and designing websites and
                  applications from scratch. My journey in software development
                  began with a Bachelor&apos;s degree in Computer Science, which
                  provided me with a solid foundation in programming and
                  problem-solving skills.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4">
                  Throughout my career, I have worked with various technologies
                  and programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and
                  Java. I have also worked with frontend frameworks like
                  React.js, Next.js, and Vue.js, and have extensive experience
                  with databases such as PostgreSQL. I have a strong background
                  in web application development, and I am particularly
                  passionate about creating user-friendly, efficient, and
                  scalable solutions.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4">
                  I am always eager to learn and grow. Apart from my project
                  work, I regularly engage in professional development
                  activities. This includes taking online courses to stay
                  updated with the latest technological trends, participating in
                  coding challenges, and contributing to open-source projects.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4">
                  If you have a project or need a software developer, I would
                  love the opportunity to collaborate with you. Letâ€™s work
                  together to bring your vision to life and create something
                  truly remarkable.
